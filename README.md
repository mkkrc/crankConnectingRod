# crank_ConnectingRod

The purpose of this is determining the operating moment of non-eccentric simple crank-connecting rod mechanism

To determine the moment, locations, outer forces and outer moments for every part of the mechanism is needed.

Location, velocity and accelaration equaiton of every part to the 'q' (location of the crank (rad) ) is calculated analitically.

Outer forces and moments is determined with free body diagrams of every part and written as related to the locations. 

Newton first and second laws written applied so the generalized inertia of the system is determined

With these equations and constants, dynamical analysis completed and operating moment for every q is determined and plotted.
